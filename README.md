                                      R Programming

I am learning how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. This is the second course in the Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization.In this course I will learn how to program in R and how to use R for effective data analysis. Also I will learn how to install and configure software necessary for a statistical programming environment and describe generic programming language concepts as they are implemented in a high-level statistical language. The course covers practical issues in statistical computing which includes programming in R, reading data into R, accessing R packages, writing R functions, debugging, profiling R code, using swirl R package and organizing and commenting R code. Topics in statistical data analysis will provide working examples.


Course Content....
Week 1: Overview of R, R data types and objects, reading and writing data
Week 2: Control structures, functions, scoping rules, dates and times
Week 3: Loop functions, debugging tools
Week 4: Simulation, code profiling
